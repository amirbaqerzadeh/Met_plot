# Weather Plot Practice

Hi! I'm Amir Baqerzadeh. Welcome to this fun project about weather plots. We use Python to make pictures from GRIB and WRF files. This is a good way to learn and practice.

## What You Need

First, you need Python on your computer. Then, install these libraries:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `pygrib`
- `wrf-python`

Use this command to install them:

```
pip install numpy matplotlib pygrib wrf-python
```

## How to Use

Run the Python scripts to make pictures from GRIB or WRF files. For example:

For GRIB file:

```
grib2/codes/open_grib_file.ipynb
```

For WRF file:

```
wrf/codes/wrf.ipynb
```



This project is for learning. Try new things and ask questions. Enjoy making weather plots!
